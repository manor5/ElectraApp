# User-Service-Role Architecture Implementation

## Overview
Successfully migrated from a single role system to a flexible User-Service-Role architecture where users can have different roles across different services.

## New Database Structure

### Tables Created:
1. **user_roles** - Stores role definitions (admin, user, manager, moderator)
2. **services** - Stores service definitions (userService, tradeService)  
3. **user_service_roles** - Junction table mapping users to services with specific roles

### Key Changes:
- Removed `role` field from `users` table
- Users now get roles through the `user_service_roles` relationship
- Supports multiple roles per user across different services

## Domain Models Created:
- `UserRole` - Role entity with name, description, active status
- `Service` - Service entity with name, description, active status  
- `UserServiceRole` - Junction entity linking user, service, and role

## Repository Interfaces & Implementations:
- `UserRoleRepository` & `UserRoleRepositoryImpl`
- `ServiceRepository` & `ServiceRepositoryImpl`
- `UserServiceRoleRepository` & `UserServiceRoleRepositoryImpl`

## Key Features:
- **Flexible Role Assignment**: Users can have different roles in different services
- **Role Management**: Add/remove/disable roles dynamically
- **Service Management**: Add new services without code changes
- **Permission Queries**: Easy to check "Does user X have role Y in service Z?"

## Migration Script:
Created `001_create_user_service_role_tables.py` to:
- Create new tables with proper foreign key relationships
- Insert default roles (admin, user, manager, moderator)
- Insert default services (userService, tradeService)
- Migrate existing user roles (optional)

## Usage Examples:
```python
# Check if user has admin role in userService
await user_service_role_repo.user_has_role_in_service(user_id=1, service_id=1, role_id=1)

# Get all services a user has access to
user_services = await user_service_role_repo.get_user_services(user_id=1)

# Get all admins in userService
admins = await user_service_role_repo.get_service_users(service_id=1, role_id=1)
```

## Benefits:
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new services and roles
- **Flexibility**: Users can have different permissions per service
- **Maintainability**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Future-proof**: Supports multi-tenant architectures
